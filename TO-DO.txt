##### WORKING ON ########
- Response Loop
>> Client call createSolution to Think Model on uvicorn port 8080 (Output: {think: text, solution: {Step 1: , Step 2: }})
>> Pick the first step in solution
>> Server calls Socrat Model (Output: a question)
>> Display and Student Response
>> Client calls checkResponse to Think Model

1) 
>> If incorrect: (Output: [student_mistake, strategy])
>> Server calls chat to Socrat Model with inputs (Output: a question)
2) 
>> If correct: (Output: [student_mistake: CORRECT, strategy: START])
>> Move solution forward by one, increase progress by one
>> Server calls chat to Socrat Model with inputs (Output: a question)

Loop Until End of Progress
