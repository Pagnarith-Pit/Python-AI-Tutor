1) Save function: DONE
2) Delete function: DONE
3) Load Conversation from Database: DONE
4) API to Real Model: DONE
5) Formatting: the outputs are just strings for now.

Working:
1) Delete function update: since there is a delay with saving, the conversation might not exist in the Database
if the user uses it for less than 5 minutes.
Need to implement shorter term memory, then when session ends OR 10 minutes, save it to persistent
 
2) Streaming: the output should stream out to be displayed

3) Call API for fun facts while waiting
